            <article class="faq-item">
                <h2>Can my daughter/Son “play up” a division?</h2>
                <p>We prefer that the concept of “playing up” be the rare exception, not the expectation. However, since we are a small club, there will be instances where we may ask certain players to play up to help fill out a team if the numbers of players do not work out exactly in each age division.</p>

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h2>May I help coach my daughter or son during their match?</h2>
                <p>Trust your child’s coach for the season. Avoid giving instructional comments at tournaments. Be supportive with positive remarks like “great effort!” or “way to go for it!” to encourage your child’s growth and enjoyment. Remember, volleyball is a fast-paced, imperfect game, and making mistakes is part of the learning process. The coach will guide your child to learn from these experiences.</p>

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h2>What is La Jolla Volleyball’s policy regarding playing time?</h2>
                <p>We ensure every player gets a chance to contribute in each match, so no one sits out a full 3-set game. If your daughter doesn't play in the first set, she'll play in the second. For younger teams, playing time is more equal if attendance, attitude, and effort are consistent. As players advance, playing time becomes more position-specific and may not be equal, but will always be fair and in the team's best interest.</p>

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h2>May I get a refund if my daughter/son quits the team?</h2>
                <p>We do not offer refunds for players that decide to discontinue or reduce their participation. At the beginning of each season, we carefully budget all club expenses (gym rental costs, tournament entry fees, uniforms, insurance, coaching stipends, etc). This budgeted amount is based upon a certain number of players paying their fees. These expenses remain fixed throughout the season, and do not go down if less players participate. Even if a player chooses to stop playing on their team, they are still responsible for their full season fees. Thank you for understanding our no refunds policy.</p>

            <article class="faq-item">
                <h2>Are there any circumstances where LJV will offer a refund?</h2>
                <p>Yes. In rare and unforeseeable circumstances we will consider a prorated refund, such as a season-ending injury or a pandemic. When COVID-19 forced our club to shut down in Spring 2020, we paused remaining payments, and processed prorated refunds to all participants.</p>
